Investigation of Bondage and FreedomIf it is said that impulses are “samsara”, if they were permanent, they would not mov
e around. Even if impermanent, they would not move around. Sentient beings too are similar in this respect.

If it is said that persons “move around,” if they are non-existent when searched for in five aspects among the aggregates
, sense fields and elements, what would move around?

If one moves around in having clung [to something] and then clinging [to something else], there would be no becoming. If 
there were no clinging and no becoming, who would move around?

It is in no way feasible that impulses go beyond misery. And it is in no way feasible that living beings go beyond misery
.

Impulses that have the properties of being born and dying are not bound and will not be freed. In the same way as above l
iving beings too are not bound and will not be freed.

If clinging binds, the one who has clinging would not be bound. And there would be no bondage without clinging. In what s
ituation would there be bondage?

If binding existed prior to one who is bound, [that unbound person] would depend on binding. That too cannot be. The rest
has been explained by the gone, the not-gone and the going.

Those who are bound will not be free. And those who are not bound will not be free. If those who are bound become free, b
ondage and freedom would be simultaneous.

“I, without clinging, am beyond misery. Nirvana is mine.” Those who grasp in that way have great grasping and clinging.

When nirvana is not born and samsara not eliminated, then what is samsara? And what is considered as nirvana?
