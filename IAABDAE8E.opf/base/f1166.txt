Investigation of AnguishSome assert that anguish arises from being made by self, made by other, by both, without cause. T
o do that is not suitable.

If it were made by self, therefore it would not be contingently arising, because those aggregates arise contingently on t
hese aggregates.

If that were other than this and if this were other than that, anguish would be made by other and that would be made by t
hose others.

If anguish were made by oneâ€™s own person, who would that person be who has made anguish by himself, but is not included i
n the anguish?

If anguish arose from another person, how could it be suitable for there to be [someone] not included in the anguish, who
has been given it by another who made the anguish?

If anguish arose [from] another person, who would that other person be who, having made it, gives it to someone else, but
is not included in the anguish?

Since it is not established as made by self, how can anguish have been made by other? [For] whatever anguish is made by o
ther, that has been made by his self.

Anguish is not made [by] self; that is not made by that itself. If it is not made by an other self, how can anguish be ma
de by other?

If it is made by each, anguish would be made by both. Not made by self, not made by other, how can anguish have no cause?

Not only does anguish alone not have the four aspects, external things too do not have the four aspects.
