Investigation of EssencesIt is unreasonable for an essence to arise from causes and conditions. Whatever essence arose fr
om causes and conditions would be something that has been made.

How is it possible for there to be “an essence which has been made?” Essences are not contrived and not dependent on anyt
hing else.

If an essence does not exist, how can the thingness of the other exist? [For] the essence of the thingness of the other i
s said to be the thingness of the other.

Apart from an essence and the thingness of the other, what things are there? If essences and thingnesses of others existe
d, things would be established.

If things were not established, non-things would not be established. [When] a thing becomes something else, people say th
at it is a non-thing.

Those who view essence, thingness of the other, things and non-things do not see the suchness in the teaching of the awak
ened.

Through knowing things and non-things, the Buddha negated both existence and non-existence in his Advice to Katyayana.

If [things] existed essentially, they would not come to non-existence. It is never the case that an essence could become 
something else.

If essences did not exist, what could become something else? Even if essences existed, what could become something else?

“Existence” is the grasping at permanence; “non-existence” is the view of annihilation. Therefore, the wise do not dwell,
in existence or non-existence.

“Since that which exists by its essence is not non-existent,” is [the view of] permanence. “That which arose before is no
w non-existent,”leads to [the view of] annihilation.
